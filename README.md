# Prism [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/prism/Prism.png)](https://travis-ci.org/prism/Prism/)

Prism is a grief-prevention and rollback plugin for Sponge-based Minecraft servers. Prism was formerly a bukkit/cauldron plugin.

Sponge is currently in development and this plugin in not ready for use at this time.

Our goal is to reproduce Prism as it was for bukkit, with coding, design, and performance improvements.

This version of Prism is still an infant but we're eager for feedback and input.
